# EXPERIENCE

Exposure Assessment Section, Human Health Assessment Branch, California Department of Pesticide Regulation  
Staff Toxicologist  \hfill 09/2022 -- current

- Conducted research topic: "Applying Bayesian Physiologically-Based Kinetic Model in Biomonitoring Data-Driven Exposure Assessment of Pyrethroids Pesticides in the US Population". The research underscores the significance of the physiologically-based kinetic (PBK) model in health risk assessments and its potential applications in future studies.
  
  Highlights:
  - Utilized National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to assess pyrethroid exposure from 1999 to 2016.
  - Compared the PBK model with the US Environmental Protection Agency high-throughput toxicokinetic model.
  - Identified exposure trends and health risks in different age groups.
  - Provided insights into model reliability and risk assessment methodologies.

- Participated in the research project from the US Environmental Protection Agency to develop a multi-compartment toxicokinetic model to quantitatively compare trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene metabolism 
- Participated in the Texas A&M Superfund research project to assess the exposure risks of complex environmental mixtures by integrating the organotypic in-vitro human stem cell assay and probabilistic concentration-response modeling

  Highlights:
  - Epidemiological investigated the relationship between lead exposure and anemia risk among workers in lead-related manufacturing industries.
  - Applied Benchmark dose modeling (BMD) approach to estimate the critical blood lead (BPb) levels-associated abnormal hematological indicators.
  - Utilized Bayesian decision analysis to determine whether BMD could be implicated as a suitable BPb standard.
